# Ex2(B) Priority Queue
## DATE: 03-03-2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm

1.Start

2.Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.

3.Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.

4.Print each element of the array during the loop.

5.After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.

6.End

## Program:
```

voidprintArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i; for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
  
*/
```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
