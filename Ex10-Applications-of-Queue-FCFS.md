## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm

1.Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays.

2.Loopthrough each process from i= 0 to n-1.

3.Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i].

4.End the algorithm.   

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression

RegisterNumber: 212223220107

int turnaroundtime( int proc[], int n,int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) {
// calculating turnaround time byadding
// burst_time[i] + wait_time[i] int i;
for ( i = 0; i < n ; i++)
tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]; return 0;
}
*/
```

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
